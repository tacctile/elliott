### 2026-05-22 — Audit Remediation: Full System Audit — 3 Critical, 10 Warnings, 9 Info

**What:** Completed remediation of all findings from the full system audit. Documentation accuracy corrections, tooling improvements, and sync fixes. No prices changed, no items changed status.

**Items Affected:**
- 1205720 — Material cost corrected from $7.01 (area method) to $7.62 (length-based method). Margin updated ~80% → ~78%. Price unchanged.
- 1278930 — override_type made more specific; laminator feed notation corrected.
- 1245130 — Added FA note, nesting causality, rounding note for $43 tier.
- 3017435 — Added FA note; Rule 14 deviation formally documented in Pricing Derivation.
- 3018378 — Rule 14 deviation formally documented in Pricing Derivation.

**Files Modified:**
- `.claude/MASTER_CONTEXT.md` — File map updated (3018378, images/, frontend/, build_frontend.py)
- `.claude/COMPLETION_TEMPLATES.md` — Added build_frontend.py triggers; added Drawing revision and Item discontinued trigger rows
- `.claude/ARCHITECTURE.md` — Corrected descriptions (3018378, 1230820); 1205720 margin ~80%→~78%; added Discontinued status
- `scripts/validate.py` — Added check_category_registry(), check_state_item_count(); fixed Pricing section detection; added Discontinued to valid statuses
- `scripts/profile.py` — Band summaries now split by item_type within each material family
- `scripts/build_frontend.py` — Added STRIP_FIELDS; replaced os.popen with datetime.now()
- `categories/cut-vinyl-3m-180mc.md` — Margin floor corrected ~64–68%→~62–65%; margin at qty 20 ~76–80%→~76–78%; $13.94→$13.93; Cardinal Red material cost note updated; Rule 14 status note added
- `categories/printed-laminated-orajet.md` — Added step 2a (laminator width check) to singles decision tree
- `items/1205720.md` — Material cost, margin table, nesting section corrected; correction note added
- `items/1278930.md` — override_type specificity; laminator feed notation corrected in notes and Nesting section
- `items/1245130.md` — FA note, nesting causality, rounding note
- `items/3017435.md` — FA note; Rule 14 deviation note
- `items/3018378.md` — Rule 14 deviation note
- `governance/SPEC_EXTRACTION.md` — Added Engineer/Drafter field to Identity and output format
- `governance/PRICING_VALIDATION.md` — Clarified "materially identical" for color variants
- `governance/PRICING_RULES.md` — Rule 14: clarified range → use midpoint as benchmark
- `governance/PRODUCTION.md` — Material cost tables: added Verified dates; 1278930 laminator description corrected; Cardinal Red cost updated to $7.62 (length-based)
- `frontend/index.html` — copyForEmail now includes first article price
- `frontend/data.json` — Rebuilt; internal fields stripped (pricing_logic, benchmark_item, downstream_items, material_cost_per_unit, cost_version_date, override_type, margin_at_qty_20)

**Key Decisions:**
- Cut vinyl margin floor band corrected to ~62–65% (floor driven by 3017435/24" roll at 61.5%; ceiling driven by corrected 1205720 at 65.4%)
- 1205720 material cost correction is documentation-only — price unchanged, relationship concession remains in effect
- validate.py now uses prefix-match for section headings (allows "(Reconstructed)" subtitles), exact-match only for "Pricing" to prevent false match on "Pricing Derivation"

**Status:** Complete. All 3 critical, 10 warning, and 9 info findings resolved. validate.py passes 0 errors, 0 warnings.

### 2026-05-22 — New Item: P/N 3018378 — D115 Olympic Blue Model Designation

**What:** Priced and documented P/N 3018378 — cut vinyl model designation label for the D115 model. Olympic Blue, 32.88" × 11.00", single color block lettering ("D115").

**Item Created:** `items/3018378.md`

**Files Updated:**
- `categories/cut-vinyl-3m-180mc.md` — added 3018378 to catalog table, updated Pricing Profile to 3 data points
- `.claude/ARCHITECTURE.md` — added 3018378 to item catalog and precedent chain; updated category registry count
- `governance/PRODUCTION.md` — added 3M 180mC-57 Olympic Blue to material costs table and quick reference
- `.claude/STATE.yml` — updated session state

**Pricing:** $35 at qty 20 (sq ft parity with P/N 1205720). Margin ~78% (Olympic Blue roll cost $162.78 vs Cardinal Red $153.60 drives slight material cost increase: $7.88 vs $7.01).

**Key Decisions:**
- Material: 3M Controltac 180mC-57 Olympic Blue — confirmed in session brief, not in prior repo data. Added to PRODUCTION.md.
- PMS caveat documented: Olympic Blue is visual approximation of PMS 2386 C, not a certified Pantone match. Must be disclosed in quote.
- Sq ft parity: 2.512 sq ft vs 2.56 sq ft benchmark — <2% difference, same tier structure.
- Labels per roll corrected: session brief stated "5 positions" (10 labels/roll). Verified: 10 positions → 20 labels/roll. Material cost unaffected.
- No first article pricing — not requested or offered.
- No AI model validation — direct parity with FA-accepted item.

**Status:** Quoted. Ready to send to Sean.

### 2026-05-22 — System Build: Notion → GitHub Migration

**What:** Migrated the entire Elliott Equipment pricing system from Notion to a structured GitHub repo (`tacctile/elliott`). Source data was validated through a 3-round audit in Claude Chat before migration.

**Items Affected:**
- All 5 items (1230820, 1278930, 1245130, 1205720, 3017435) — converted to structured markdown with YAML frontmatter

**Files Created:**
- Full `.claude/` context system (MASTER_CONTEXT, ARCHITECTURE, CHAT_CONTEXT, COMPLETION_TEMPLATES, STATE, PROGRESS, settings.json)
- Full `governance/` doc set (SPEC_EXTRACTION, STRUCTURE_RULES, PRICING_VALIDATION, PRICING_RULES, PRODUCTION)
- 2 category files with Pricing Profiles
- 5 item files with complete frontmatter + all 10 required sections
- Validation and profile scripts
- README, .gitignore

**Key Decisions:**
- MASTER_CONTEXT kept lean — account identity and routing only, no narrative
- Governance split into 5 files (was 1 Notion page) for single-responsibility
- Equipment/production details in their own file (PRODUCTION.md) — changes on different cadence than pricing rules
- CHAT_CONTEXT designed for dual-path operation (Claude Code prompts + direct conversation)
- Pricing Profiles embedded in category files, not separate documents

**Status:** Complete. System ready for first new item.
